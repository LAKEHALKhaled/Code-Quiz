 ## Web APIs: Code Quiz

A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

We needed to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. with a polished, and responsive user interface.
